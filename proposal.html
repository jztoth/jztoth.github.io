<h2 class="ex3">Quantifying Land Cover Change in Dryland Environments using Convolutional Neural Networks and Remote Sensing Data</h2>

<br>
<h3>1. Introduction</h3>	
<p>Drylands cover approximately 46% of the world’s land surface and are home to 3 billion people (IPCC, 2019). 
They are extremely fragile ecosystems and susceptible to land degradation and desertification. 
They are generally under-studied because they are often of low economic value and are difficult to assess with traditional 
remote sensing techniques. This is due to several factors: 1. Spectral differences between dryland land covers (semi-dessert, grassland, 
cultivated land, shrubland, savannah) are often quite subtle. 2. High seasonal and annual fluctuations in vegetation greenness due to 
variations in precipitation can overwhelm background environmental changes. 3. Sparse shrubs and trees are difficult captured on common 
20-30 m spatial resolution satellite images.</p>

<div class="ex1">
<p>
I will use satellite remote sensing data and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to develop a methodology to accurately and 
consistently classify land cover type in drylands. I will apply this methodology to Southern African drylands to quantify land cover change.

<h3>2. Background (why this is an important topic)</h3>
<p>Arid zones are characterized by water scarcity, drought, high climatic variability, and land degradation, including desertification 
and loss of biodiversity (Gaur and Squires, 2018). The UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) estimates that between 2015 and 2019 
the world lost at least 100 million hectares of productive land each year to desertification, adding up to an area twice the size of 
Greenland (UNCCD, 2023).</p>

<p>
Drylands are usually defined by the aridity index (AI) which is the ratio of annual precipitation to potential evapotranspiration; 
Hyper-Arid < 0.05, Arid = 0.05-0.2, Semiarid = 0.2-0.5, Dry Subhumid = 0.5-0.65 (Safriel et al., 2005). In general, arid regions receive 
less than 250 mm of precipitation per year. Semi-Arid regions receive 250-500 mm per year. Existing water shortages in drylands are 
projected to increase over time due to population increase, land cover change, and climate change (Safriel et al., 2005).</p>

<p>
Drylands include desert, grassland, and savanna woodland biomes (Mortimore et al., 2009). They support 50% of the world's livestock, 
44% of the world's cultivated land, and they are home to more than a third of the world’s population. Over 90% of these people live in 
developing countries, many of them small scale farmers and herders, and have the world’s highest population growth rates (UN, 2011).</p>

<p>
Desertification refers to land degradation in arid, semi-arid and sub-humid areas, this degradation usually results from direct human
 activities (mainly agriculture and urban expansion) and climate change. Globally, 24% of all land is degrading. Approximately 50% of this 
 is within drylands, threatening the livelihoods of more than 1 billion people in 100 countries (UN, 2011). Drylands also suffer from water
 shortages, floods, soil lose, soil degradation, low agricultural productivity, as well as human poverty and conflict often driven by scarce
 natural resources.</p>

<p>
Dryland regions include the western USA and Mexico, southwestern South America, the Brazilian Caatiga, the Mediterranean basin, North Africa, 
southern and eastern Africa, the Middle East, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and large parts of India, Central Asia, northwest China, and Mongolia, 
and Australia (Figure 1).

<h3>3. Previous Work: Traditional Methods</h3>
<p>By analysing global precipitation and temperature datasets from 1948-2008 and climate model simulations for 1948-2100, Feng and Fu (2013) 
showed that between 1950 and 2000 global drylands expanded approximately 4%, and that by the end of this century they will increase by a 
further 10%. Using corrected climate model simulations Huang et al. (2016) estimate dryland biomes could expand by 11% to 23% by the end of the 
century, and will then cover more than half of the world’s land surface.</p>
<p>
Quantifying changes in landcover in drylands using remote sensing is notoriously difficult for a number of reasons: Trees and shrubs are often 
sparse and difficult to identify, and dark tree shadows can be misleading; Vegetation greenness is strongly controlled by seasonal and intra-annual
 rainfall variations and it is easy to confuse an unexpected dry spell with land cover change; Subtle differences between native grasslands, 
 invasive species, shrub-lands, savannah, and cultivated land are also difficult to delineate on satellite images.</p>
<p>
To overcome some of these problems Bastin et al. (2017) attempted to determine global dryland forest cover using very high resolution (~1m) 
Google Earth images and visually counted trees for hundreds of thousands of sample landscapes, using an online participatory approach with 
scientists and students from around the world. They estimate that of 61 million km2 of global drylands, 5.5 million km2 are open forest 
(10-40% canopy cover), and 7.77 million km2 are closed forest (>40% canopy cover). These estimates are 40% to 195% higher than recent estimates 
best upon Landsat data. They also indicate that the dryland forests are, surprisingly, slightly larger in area than the moist tropical forests.</p>
<p>
A Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) report on trees, forests, and land use in drylands (FAO, 2019) is based upon the same visual approach 
as Bastin et al. (2017) but they also included other dryland biomes. They list six dryland categories; 1). Forest, land with trees higher 
than 5 metres and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent. 2). Other wooded land, land with trees higher than 5 metres and a canopy cover 
of 5 to 10 percent. 3). Cropland, includes cropped land and agroforestry systems where the vegetation structure falls below the thresholds 
used for the forest land category. 4). Grassland, includes rangelands and pasture land not considered cropland or forest. 5). Built-up, 
includes all developed land, including transportation infrastructure and human settlements of any size. 6). Barren land, includes mainly 
sand and dunes, rock, ice (Figure 2). The definitions of these categories leave some room for ambiguity and highlight the difficulty in 
simply defining land classification categories.</p>
<p>
Bastin et al. (2017) and FAO (2019) visually interpreted high-resolution images, but the most common methods for quantifying changing 
dryland land cover are Aridity Index (from precipitation and temperature data), Normalised Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI), and 
rain-use efficiency. </p>
<p>
Diouf and Lambin (2001) evaluated land cover degradation in a semi-arid pastoral region of Senegal, with annual rainfall of 100-400 mm. 
The region is an open savanna and bush landscape. They reported that the greatest difficulty in assessing land-cover modifications in semi-arid 
regions is to separate the effect of human activity from the effects of interannual climatic fluctuations. They concluded that land cover 
modifications are best measured by changes in rain-use efficiency. This is a popular indicator used in drylands and is a ratio of NDVI to 
precipitation; in healthy environments high rainfall will lead to high NDVI. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is itself 
often used as a proxy variable for net primary production. Diouf and Lambin (2001) validated their results with detailed on-the-ground 
measurement of biomass.</p>
<p>
On a more local scale, supervised classification on multi-spectral Landsat/Sentinel images is often used for land cover classification in 
drylands. Matlhodi et al. (2019) and Mugari and Masundire (2022) both evaluated land-use and land cover (LULC) changes in Botswana using 
Landsat imagery and supervised classification using a Maximum Likelihood classifier. Major LULC categories were vegetation, cropland, 
bare land, shrub land, built-up area, tree savanna and water bodies. In the thirty-year period between 1984 and 2015, Matlhodi et al. (2019) 
observed 29% losses for shrub land and 71% loses for tree savanna. Mugari and Masundire (2022) observed a decline in vegetation by 50 km2/year 
between 1995 and 2016 and an increase in croplands (34 km2/year). Mugari and Masundire (2022) used three sets of Landsat images for the 
post-rainy period of 1995, 2006, and 2016 (each year with 4 scenes). The dates were specifically chosen as vegetation, croplands and bare 
lands are more distinct after the rainy season. Regions of interest were selected on each satellite image for training samples for supervised 
classification, each region had between 80 and 150 individual training polygons.</p>

<h3>4. Previous Work: Deep Learning methods</h3>

<p>
More recently attention has turned to Deep Learning (DL) for land cover classification, with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent 
Neural Networks (RNN) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) used in place of more traditional methods such as Decision Trees, Randon 
Forests, or K-nearest neighbours (Cecili et al. 2023). Carranza-Garcia et al. (2019) report that the capacity of CNNs to encode spectral 
and spatial information of remote sensing images has led to a substantial improvement in the efficiency of the land use and land cover (LULC) 
classification, and that CNNs have better performance than other DL models. Cecili et al. (2023) also report that of the Deep Learning methods 
CNNs have proved to be the most effective for LULC classification, with VGGNet, AlexNet, ResNet and DenseNet models most common. Cecili et al. 
(2023) compared VGG16, DenseNet and ResNet models on Sentinel-2 data for LULC classification in the Rome area. 
They found that the VGG16 model 
(this is a classic deep CNN model with 13 convolution layers, 3 fully connected layers, and a 3x3 filter size) gave the best 
result (71% accuracy).</p>

</p>
Luan et al. (2023) trained a classical CNN model on 0.6 m resolution Google Earth RGB images to improve the urban land classification 
accuracy for seven dryland cities in Asia. They noted that in drylands it is more difficult to differentiate urban from non-urban areas 
with remote sensing data due to a lack of distinct spectral response. They used a GoogLeNet InceptionV3 CNN model (Inception models can 
have variable filter sizes) with five categories; vegetation, cultivated land, artificial surfaces, water bodies, and others. Typical 
dryland samples were extracted from a public benchmark dataset derived from Google Earth high-resolution imagery for model training. 
This dataset covered labelled land types in China and 10,000 labelled images of each land type in typical dryland regions were selected as 
training samples. They obtained an overall accuracy of 92% which is significantly higher than the standard global land cover products, 
e.g., ESA World Cover 2020, ESRI 2020 landcover, GlobalLand 30, FROM-GLC 2017, which have accuracies of between 75% and 61%.</p>


<p>
Kattenborn et al. (2021) reviewed the use of CNNs in vegetation remote sensing. They note that a series of recent studies have demonstrated 
that CNNs are very effective at extracting a wide array of vegetation properties from remote sensing data, and that the ability of a CNN to 
exploit spatial patterns particularly facilitates the value of very high spatial resolution data. Song et al (2019) comment on the trade-off 
between spectrally-rich datasets which tend to have lower spatial resolutions (20-30 m) compared to high-resolution RGB and panchromatic 
datasets (1-15 m). Higher spatial resolution also often results in less coverage.

<p>
CNNs can be 1D, 2D and 3D, where the number refers to the dimensions of the kernel (Kattenborn et al. 2021). 1D CNNs are less often used for 
land cover classification because they do not explicitly consider spatial context. Most studies apply 2D CNNs, as these exploit spatial patterns 
in imagery. The added value of spatial patterns, of 2D versus 1D CNNs, has also been demonstrated with medium-resolution Landsat data. 3D CNNs 
are rarely used in Earth Observation (Kattenborn et al. 2021).

<p>
However, Song et al (2019) suggest that a large labelled training set needed for a traditional 2D CNN model is often not available for satellite 
images. They propose that a 1D, single-pixel, CNN model will perform better than a 2D CNN model with a limited training data set, especially if 
unmixing-based methods to decompose each pixel into multiple signals that reflect the signature of each constituent landcover type are used. Song et al. (2019) report that the most frequently used labelled land cover classification datasets (the US National Land Cover Database (NLCD), GeoCover, and GlobeLand30) have a spatial resolution of 30 meters, which is sufficient to identify large-scale objects but not small-scale objects. If the pixel contains more than one material class, classification performance decreases and reduces the effectiveness of the 2D model. At the same time, newer, high-resolution datasets (which are better for 2D models) may encourage sparse labelling since it is tedious and time consuming to label (Song et al. 2019). 

<p>
Carranza-Garcia et al. (2019) produced a general 2D CNN model with a fixed architecture for LULC classification from remote sensing data, 
particularly hyperspectral and radar data. Their model was similar to a traditional AlexNet or VGG model but with only two convolutional layers 
and a single fully connected layer. The first convolutional layer had 32 filters and the second layer had 64 filters. The stride for the 
convolutions was 1, with same padding. The fully connected layer had 1024 neurons. The filter size was 3x3 with a ReLU activation function. 
The stride for the Max Pooling was 2. A final Softmax layer was used for the classification with the number of neurons equal to the desired 
number of classes. They report extremely high accuracy rates of over 96% on data from the Geoscience Remote Sensing Society (GRSS) DASE 
competition website. 

<p>
Scott et al. (2017) noted that obtaining a sufficiently large training set is often the major problem for using CNNs in remote sensing; we have 
a very large set of satellite images but lack labelled information. They used data augmentation (increasing the sample quantity by rotating or 
flipping the existing training samples) and transfer learning (re-using a previously trained model) to increase the effectiveness of their models. 
They tested GoogLeNet, ResNet, and CaffeNet CNNs on the UC Merced landcover data set. The UC Merced data set includes 21 classes with just 100 
images per class (with a 256x256 pixel size). They obtained a classification accuracy of over 97% for all three models.

<p>
Gharbia et al. (2021) assessed different CNNs to classify land cover in Egypt along the Nile Valley and Delta. The models were trained on just 
500 sub-images manually derived from Landsat data (from 5 full Landsat images), each of these sub-images was 227x227 pixels and represented 
1 of 5 land cover classes (Water, Urban, Agriculture, Roads, Desert). Using augmentation techniques, the dataset was expanded to 3500 training 
images. On the augmented dataset they obtained accuracies of 90% for an AlexNet CNN model, and 95% using a VGG16 CNN model.

<p>
Following on from the FAO visual assessment of dryland tree cover (FAO, 2019), Guirado et al. (2020) repeated the exercise but using a 
InceptionV3 CNN model with Tensor Flow (this is one of the most widely used CNN models). They used very high resolution RGB images from 
Google Earth (71,000 images), and used labelled data from the FAO Dry Lands Assessment. Images of non-Forest class were obtained from 
Northwestern Polytechnical University NWPU-RESISC45 dataset. Guirado et al. (2020) reported that regions of low tree cover or high tree 
cover were easier to assess than intermediate tree cover. They also showed that the models were most accurate when they did not include 
non-forest classes (which can confuse the model), e.g. it is easier to simply quantify tree cover within forest areas rather than also 
quantify non-forest areas. Guirado et al. (2020) also report that it is difficult to obtain very high resolution (VHR) images in many areas 
of the globe, especially Africa. The overall accuracy of their model was 79%, which was higher than from the FOA study.

<h3>5. Work Plan Outline</h3>

Applications of CNNs for classification of arid landscapes are comparatively rare in the literature and they do not explicitly address the 
precipitation problem (rapid changes in vegetation greenness following precipitation in drylands can lead to mis-classification of land cover). 
The objective of this research project is to develop a CNN specifically for land cover classification in dry land environments using remote 
sensing data. I propose to begin with a traditional CNN architecture (e.g. Carranza-Garcia et al. 2019) and adapt the architecture and 
hyperparameters for dry land environments. Whether very high-resolution Google Earth RGB images or multispectral Landsat/Sentinel images 
give the best results will be determined.

<p>
Southern Africa is a dryland region (mainly arid and semi-arid biomes) with global significance in terms of biodiversity (Figure 1). 
However, it is subject to habitat loss and environmental degradation from unsustainable development, agriculture, alien species invasion, 
climate change, and over exploitation of natural resources (Agence Francaise de Developpement, 2018). I will select a region in Southern 
Africa to develop the dryland CNN model, depending upon the availability of remote sensing data and training data. I will use the model to 
quantify land cover change over time.

<p>
Software used will be Python/Anaconda with Pytorch libraries and QGIS for mapping.</p>
