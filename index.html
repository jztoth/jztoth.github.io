<STRONG><A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">Git</A> is a system that allows you to keep track of different versions
of your code (and data). 
You can also set up an internet address where others can get hold of the work. A popular implementation of this is
the <A href="https://github.com/">GitHub</A> website (<A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub">Wikipedia</A>), 
which provides free space for <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">Open Source</A> projects, including 
website space. GitHub is popular to the point that Git and GitHub are almost synonymous. This tutorial will walk 
you through using both together, using GitHub's version of the Git software.</STRONG>

Git is a code repository and versioning/revision control system, that is, it sets up somewhere you can store code and which keeps track of different versions of your code 
so you can undo/"roll back" changes if you need to. However, as code is just text, it also allows for uploading and tracking of other stuff, such as data.

The first thing you'll need to do is to set up a GitHub account. Go to the
 <A href="https://github.com/">GitHub</A> site and do that now. Obviously only do this if you are 
happy with their terms and conditions. Choose a username with all lower case letters and numbers, anything else may cause problems 
with setting up a website as instructed.
